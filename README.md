<br><br>Name's outside the screen is Kevin, and that one gray pixel horse I play with most of the time is my ponysona, Kenhorō.
<br><br>I like many stuff, but not very into joining fandoms, then at the rare chance something catches my eye, I will have an obsession to it for decades, if not forever...
<br><br>Usually I roam around the map randomly, but Homestuck zone is my home, I can be there even if my pony is not related to the fandom.
<br><br>I know some of my ponies can look a bit spooky, but I promise I don't bite! 
<br>Feel free to ask for cuddle and hide (C+H) at any time!
<br>And if im not responding, highly probably im off game, send me a whisper and I will be there ASAP!
<br><br>I have anger issues, tho. But I take my meds and try to be the most patient as possible! I know this is the internet and not everyone is having a nice day lately, so we should fight to stay gentle!
